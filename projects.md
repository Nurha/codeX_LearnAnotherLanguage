# Projects to Try

## 1. Mobile phone budget tool

The Goal: Budget for your calls by choosing your service provider and your current airtime, to see how many calls or SMS's you can make.
When the app starts it should prompt the user for their mobile phone provider, then show them a list of available plans to choose from. Then they can enter their current airtime balance, to see how many calls, SMSs or how much data usage they have availabe.

Concepts to keep in mind:

* Maps
* Functions
* Variables
* Input/Output
* If/Else statements
* Print

## 2. Guess the Number

The Goal: This project uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.

Concepts to keep in mind:

* Random function
* Variables
* Integers
* Input/Output
* Print
* While loops
* If/Else statements


## 3. Mad Libs Generator

The Goal: Inspired by Summer Son’s Mad Libs project with Javascript. The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template. You’ll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included.

Concepts to keep in mind:

* Strings
* Variables
* Concatenation
* Print
